A simple global scheduler developed to work with the SHARCNET Cluster of Clusters. 
Using pexpect, it ssh to the clusters in a list and run many comands of the LSF local scheduler. After that, it can choose the most available cluster that meets the user requirenments.

Part of my masters thesis, it can be helpfull if you want an example of using pexpect to make a python program interact with a computer.
